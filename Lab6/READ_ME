There are 2 .c files: server.c and client.c

1) Compilation of server.c

	gcc server.c -o server -lpthread

2) Execution of server.c ( here 8081 is the post number)

	./server 8081

3) Compilation of client.c

	gcc client.c -o client

4) Execution of client ( enter IP and port number as command line input)

	./client 127.0.0.1 8081


Some general points to keep in mind for execution:

-> 	Total 4 clients can connect at a time to the server
-> 	For identification purpose, each client has an id which is displayed along with the message in the server
-> 	The id can be reused for a new client if that particular client exits
->	The clients can send their text in any order
->	The server will respond to the client in first-come-first server basis. So if 2 clients have sent their text to the server, server will first take input for the first client which sent its message.
->	Any client above the limit will be made to exit
